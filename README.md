#### The project is designed for those who can no longer afford to travel abroad but can still buy a train ticket.
## The project uses the following technologies:

HTML.
CSS.
Version control system GIT.
IDE editor VS Code.
BEM.
Grid
Plans for project improvement:

Refine the intervals between elements as specified in Figma using media queries.
Figure out why the footer block has no bottom margin.
I hope I'll have enough time during the holidays to work on this :)

And here is the project
